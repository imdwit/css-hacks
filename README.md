### Contributions

The easiest way to get started is to run `npm run new`

It will ask for your name, the title and description of the post, and then inject that into the frontmatter of a new markdown file for you located in `src/blog/[title-of-blog-post]`

`npm start` simply runs `gatsby develop` as you would normally, assuming you already have a blog post in progress or you want to start a new post yourself.

#### Other things

- Write about whatever you want, as long as it's frontend related
