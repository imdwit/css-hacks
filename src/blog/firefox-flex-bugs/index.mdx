import { WithRotation, DoesntScrollFF, WithoutRotation } from "./demo.js"

This was about a year ago. For the chat feature of our app at work, we relied on [`flexbox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) and `column-reverse` to set the order in which messages came in.

Part of the challenge was keeping the scroll position at the _bottom_ of the window.
There's a [bug in Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1042151) where it doesn't scroll when you apply `overflow-y` and `column-reverse`.

<small>initial css:</small>

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column-reverse;
height: 225px;
overflow-y: scroll;
border: 1px solid #eee;
border-radius: 4px;
padding: 2px 4px;
```

<br />

Taking advantage of the [`@supports` feature query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports), I can apply Firefox specific stylings.

<small>This Div should not scroll in firefox</small>
<DoesntScrollFF />

<br/>
<br/>
So to get around that I tried to use css rotation.

I rotated the whole list 180deg, and then rotated each list item itself back 180deg so they are right side up.

<br />

```css
@supports (-moz-appearance: none) {
  ul {
    border: 1px solid red !important;
    flex-direction: column !important;
    -moz-transform: rotate3d(1, 0, 0, 180deg);
    & li {
      -moz-transform: rotate3d(1, 0, 0, 180deg);
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

<small>This div should be red in Firefox.</small>

<WithRotation />

However if I recall correctly that caused issues with Safari 11.
It flipped the scroll direction.

Unfortunately I don't have access to Safari 11 to test or get
screenshots. You'll just have to trust me

So I had to go back to the drawing board.

<br />

This time I took advantage of [css custom properties](https://css-tricks.com/css-attr-function-got-nothin-custom-properties)

I encode an `order` property on the list item as a css custom property.

```javascript
export const WithoutRotation = () => (
  <WithoutRotation_>
    <StyledUl>
      {xs.map(n => (
        <li style={{ "--order": n * -1 }}>this is a message {n}</li>
      ))}
    </StyledUl>
  </WithoutRotation_>
)
```

Then in the css, only for Firefox I reset the `ul`'s flex direction to `column` and
essentially reverse the order with the flexbox `order` property
(multiplying it by -1).

```css
@supports (-moz-appearance: none) {
  ul {
    border: 1px solid blue !important;
    flex-direction: column !important;
    & li {
      order: var(--order);
    }
  }
}
```

<small>This div should be blue in Firefox.</small>

<WithoutRotation />

Which as you can see almost works. The only problem is the scroll
position is at the top. but the messages are in order.

I forget exactly what changed, but this hack is no longer in our codebase.
I've been meaning to write about it for a while.
Stay tuned for more.
