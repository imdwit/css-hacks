import {WithRotation, DoesntScrollFF, WithoutRotation} from './demo.js';


for the chat feature of our app at work, we relied on `flexbox` and `column-reverse` to set the order in which messages came in.

Part of the challenge was keeping the scroll position at the *bottom* of the window.
Firefox doesn't scroll when you apply `flex` and `column-reverse`
This Div should not scroll in firefox
<DoesntScrollFF />


So to get around that I tried to use css rotation
<WithRotation />

However if I recall correctly that caused issues with Safari 11

Unfortunately I don't have access to Safari 11 to test or get
screenshots. You'll just have to trust me

So I had to go back to the drawing board.


This time I took advantage of [custom properties](https://css-tricks.com/css-attr-function-got-nothin-custom-properties/")


I encode an `order` property on the list item as a css custom property.


Then in the css I reset the `ul`'s flex direction to `column` and
essentially reverse the order with the flexbox `order` property
(multiplying it by -1)

<WithoutRotation />

Which as you can see almost works. The only problem is the scroll
position is at the top. but the messages are in order.
